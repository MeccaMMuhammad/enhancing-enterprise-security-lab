# enhancing-enterprise-security-lab
This repository documents my hands-on work from the **Enhancing Enterprise Security** lab. It includes Linux and Windows server hardening techniques, firewall configurations, and secure protocol implementations. This lab directly supports my journey toward becoming a Linux Systems Administrator and aligns with **CompTIA Security+ Objective 4.5**.
